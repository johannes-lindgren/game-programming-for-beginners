= TODO

Not yet sure where to put these topics:

- Mutation
- Draw image
- Play Sound
- Resizing
- Split screen
- Restart game
- Publishing
- `requestAnimationFrame`
- Syntax error
- Runtime errors
- Expressions and statements
- Hex colors

- Starter project
  - Allow top-level `await`: `build: {target: 'esnext'}`

Consider including these:

- World generation--big topic though.
- Online multiplayer--tough one
